What we have right now:

  - scrapping script that returns all the blogs on hypem with a certain set of parameters that we can extract directly from hypem.

First bunch of parameters â€” country and genre: inhereted from aggregated pages under "Blogs" category on hypem
Second bunch - parameters that can be extracted from the individual page about the blog on hypem. EXample: http://hypem.com/blog/all+things+go/552
What we can get from there:
  - # of tracks
  - # of followers (proxy for popularity)
  - recent genres
  - some keywords from the "Latest posts from" section (suggestion: sort by "Most favorites")
